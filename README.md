# Tree-Sitter grammar for the SUS Language

Generated using [tree-sitter](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/). Used as the parsing front-end of the [sus-compiler](https://crates.io/crates/sus-compiler). 

The SUS compiler repository is [here](https://github.com/pc2/sus-compiler). 

This package provides bindings for C, C++, and Rust. (And tree-sitter implemented a few more but who's counting. )

The language definition is in [grammar.js](grammar.js). For examples, see the SUS compiler repository.
